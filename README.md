Continuous code review for AI coding agents. roborev runs in the
background, reviews every commit as agents write code, and surfaces
issues in seconds -- before they compound. Pull code reviews into
your agentic loop while context is fresh.

![roborev TUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roborev-dev/roborev-docs/main/public/tui-hero.svg)

## How It Works

1. Run `roborev init` to install a post-commit hook
2. Every commit triggers a background review -- agents write, roborev reads
3. View findings in the TUI, feed them to your agent, or let `roborev fix` handle it

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init          # Install post-commit hook
git commit -m "..."   # Reviews happen automatically
roborev tui           # View reviews in interactive UI
```

## Features

- **Background Reviews** - Every commit is reviewed automatically via
  git hooks. No workflow changes required.
- **Auto-Fix** - `roborev fix` feeds review findings to an agent that
  applies fixes and commits. `roborev refine` iterates until reviews pass.
- **Code Analysis** - Built-in analysis types (duplication, complexity,
  refactoring, test fixtures, dead code) that agents can fix automatically.
- **Multi-Agent** - Works with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot,
  OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, Kilo, Droid, and Pi.
- **Runs Locally** - No hosted service or additional infrastructure.
  Reviews are orchestrated on your machine using the coding agents
  you already have configured.
- **Interactive TUI** - Real-time review queue with vim-style navigation.
- **Review Verification** - `roborev compact` verifies findings against
  current code, filters false positives, and consolidates related issues
  into a single review.
- **Extensible Hooks** - Run shell commands on review events. Built-in
  [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) integration creates trackable issues from
  review failures automatically.

## The Agentic Fix Loop

When reviews find issues, copy-and-paste the reviews into your
interactive agent sessions, or invoke the `roborev:fix` skills. You
can also address open reviews on the command line non-interactively
with `roborev fix`.

`roborev fix` shows the review findings to an agent, which applies
changes and commits. The new commit gets reviewed automatically,
closing the loop.

For fully automated iteration (advanced feature), use `refine`:

```bash
roborev refine                  # Fix, re-review, repeat until passing
```

`refine` runs in an isolated worktree and loops: fix findings, wait for
re-review, fix again, until all reviews pass or `--max-iterations` is hit.

## Code Analysis

Run targeted analysis across your codebase and optionally auto-fix:

```bash
roborev analyze duplication ./...           # Find duplication
roborev analyze refactor --fix *.go         # Suggest and apply refactors
roborev analyze complexity --wait main.go   # Analyze and show results
roborev analyze test-fixtures *_test.go     # Find test helper opportunities
```

Available types: `test-fixtures`, `duplication`, `refactor`, `complexity`,
`api-design`, `dead-code`, `architecture`.

Analysis jobs appear in the review queue. Use `roborev fix <id>` to
apply findings later, or pass `--fix` to apply immediately.

## Installation

**Shell Script (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
brew install roborev-dev/tap/roborev
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://roborev.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**With Go:**
```bash
go install github.com/roborev-dev/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
```

## Developer Setup

This repo uses [`prek`](https://prek.j178.dev/) for local pre-commit checks.
The hook is a local system hook that runs `make lint`, so pre-commit can apply
`golangci-lint --fix` automatically instead of using the upstream
`golangci-lint` pre-commit repository. The hook is configured with
`always_run = true`, so it runs on every commit, not just commits that touch
Go files.

```bash
brew install prek     # or use your preferred prek install method
prek install          # install the local git hook
prek run --all-files  # run the configured checks manually
```

If the hook rewrites files, re-stage them and re-run `git commit`. Use
`make lint-ci` when you want a non-mutating lint check.
